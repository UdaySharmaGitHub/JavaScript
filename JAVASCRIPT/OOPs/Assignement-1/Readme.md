# Assignement Instructions: Object Oriented Programming
## Task 1: Code a Person class

Code a Person class, with three parameters in the constructor: name, age, and energy.

Set the default parameters in the Person class as follows:

```
name = "Tom"

age = 20

energy = 100
```

Code two methods in the `Person` class. Name those methods `sleep()` and `doSomethingFun()`.

The `sleep()` method should take the existing energy level and increase it by 10.

The doSomethingFun() method should take the existing energy level and decrease it by 10.
<br><br>

## Task 2: Code a Worker class

Code a sub-class, inheriting from the `Person` class, and name it `Worker`.

The `Worker` class has two additional parameters in the constructor: 
    - xp (for "experience points")
    - hourlyWage.

These properties are set to the following default values:
```
xp = 0

hourlyWage = 10
```
The `Worker` class has all the paramerters and methods of its super-class.

Additionally, it has the `goToWork()` method, which, whenever it's run, increases the value of the `xp` property by 10.
<br><br>

## Task 3: Code a intern object

Inside the intern function instantiate the `Worker` class to code a new intern object.

The intern should have the following characteristics:
```
name: Bob

age: 21

energy: 110

xp: 0

hourlyWage: 10
```

Run the `goToWork()` method on the intern object. Then `return` the intern object.

<br><br>


## Task 4: Code a manager object

Inside the manager function instantiate the `Worker` class to code a new `manager` object.

The manager object should have the following characteristics:
```
name: Alice

age: 30

energy: 120

xp: 100

hourlyWage: 30
```

Run the `doSomethingFun()` method on the manager object. Then `return` the manager object.
